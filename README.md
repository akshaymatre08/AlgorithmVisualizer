# Graph Algorithms Visualizer
---
Graph Algorithms visualizer project which visualizes Different types of graph algorithms on a MxN Grid
- Path-finding algorithms 
    - Depth-First-Search
    - Breadth-First-Search
    - A\* using Manhattan Distance h(n)
    - Dijkstra (Uniform-Cost-Search variant)
    - Greedy-Best-First Search using Manhattan Distance
    - Bidirectional Search 
        - A\*
        - BFS
        - Greedy-BFS
        - Dijsktra (UCS)
- Random Maze Generation Algorithms (Random Spanning Trees)
    - Prim's Algorithm
    - Recursive Backtracker
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms 
    - Prim's Algorithm
- Topological Sorting
    - Kahn's Algorithm

I have used Javascript, Jquery along with HTML and CSS .

I have taken reference from - Stack overflow(whenever I got stuck it saved me :) )

I would like to thank my team memebers
    1) Akshay Matre (myself)
    2) Samiksha Dhumal
    3) Bhagyashri bagul
    4) Akshay Gade
& also Sudarshan Hon (senior) and Akanksha Thokade (friend) for their constant help and support.
